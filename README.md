# Competitive-Programming
Algorithms and such

This a repository to gather some algorithms/data structures/pieces of code that I find interesting or stumble upon and find useful for Competitive Programing. Note that there might (and will) be some messy code because of the way that I learn. For example: reading about an algorithm for a while and trying to implement it for the first time within the next two hours without looking for more information to make sure that I understand the algorithm.
